   <div class="row">
       <div class="col-md-12">
             <p>The Minister of Works and Housing, Mr. Babatunde Fashola (SAN), yesterday called on Nigerians to support the country’s armed forces and preserve the memory of those who died defending the nation.
              He urged Nigerians to join hands with government to promote peace and security in the country, saying that doing so would mean that the sacrifices made by the fallen heroes were not in vain.
              Fashola, who spoke at the headquarters of the ministry where he was decorated with the 2022 Armed Forces Remembrance Day Emblem, explained that the promotion of peace did not necessarily mean the absence of conflicts and disagreement, but the resolution of those conflicts before they degenerate
              “As human beings with our diversity, we could have so many conflicts and disagreement, but those conflicts must not lead to violence or lead to clashes. Those conflicts must be resolved before the day is over and this is the job that is everybody’s responsibility, not only those in government but to all Nigerians”, he said.
              He pointed out that if all Nigerians chose to live together the issue of conflict resolution would be an easy task.
              “And the less conflict we have, the less people who will have to lay down their lives to bring such conflicts to an end and the less widows and widowers and orphaned children we will have; and the more that happens daily, the better our country will be,” he added.
              Urging all Nigerians, both at home and in the diaspora, to support the cause of the Armed Forces Remembrance Day, the minister commended President Muhammadu Buhari for leading from the front at all times and making the upkeep of those left behind by the nation’s fallen heroes a priority.

                              Nesmen report that Davido had earlier announced that N200 million received from friends and colleagues would be donated to orphanages in Nigeria.
                              Newsmen also reported that Davido announced a personal donation of N50 million to increase the money to N250 million for distribution.
                              Newsmen report that ahead of his 29th birthday, on Nov. 19, Davido had opened a Wema Bank account and asked friends and colleagues to donate one million naira each.

                                             <p>The Chinese Foreign Ministry in Beijing has urged Chinese citizens and firms working in Africa to leave risky areas in Nigeria, Congo and other parts of the African continent.
                                              The foreign ministry spokesperson, Zhao Lijian, who confirmed the abduction of five Chinese nationals in the Democratic Republic of Congo, also warned the Chinese citizens against travelling to some risky areas.
                                              The spokesperson said the abductions in Congo took place during an attack by “unknown” gunmen on a mine in the village of Mukera in eastern Congo.                    
                                              Zhao said the attack also left one police officer dead.
                                              He said, in another recent incident in Nigeria, three Chinese employees were also kidnapped by armed robbers at a Chinese private company in Kogi State, Nigeria.
                                              “An armed guard police at the site was injured. A task force formed by Nigeria is carrying out the rescue,” he added.
                                              He stressed that there were great security risks in Nigeria and Congo, and these incidents were not the first of their kind either.
                                              “Since the beginning of this year, kidnapping of Chinese citizens in the DRC and Nigeria happens from time to time, raising the security risk.
                                              He said that China’s Foreign Ministry, embassies and consulates had previously advised nationals not to go to high-risk areas.<!----
                                              “The Chinese Foreign Ministry and Chinese embassies and consulates have issued multiple warnings to Chinese citizens, dissuading them from travelling to regions of high risks for the time being, and advised companies and personnel in high-risk areas to relocate or evacuate as soon as possible,
                                              “Here, we would once again remind Chinese businesses and citizens abroad to closely follow security risks in countries concerned and security alerts issued by the Foreign Ministry and embassies and consulates concerned.
                                              “Chinese citizens should voluntarily touch base with the embassy and consulate, better protect themselves and step up contingency preparations.-->

                                                              Mental alertness. Drinking coffee and other beverages that contain caffeine throughout the day seems to increase alertness and clear thinking. Caffeine can also improve alertness after sleep deprivation. Even one drink of coffee can reduce fatigue and increase alertness.
                                                              Coffee is a drink made from coffee beans, which are the roasted fruit of the Coffea arabica bush.

People most commonly drink coffee to relieve mental and physical fatigue and to increase mental alertness. Coffee is also used to prevent Parkinson disease, dementia, and many other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support many of these uses.
